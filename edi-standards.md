# ANSI ASC X12

ANSI (American National Standards) ASC (Accredited Standards Committee) X12 goes by more than one pseudonym. This standard is also sometimes called ANSI X12 Standard or just simply X12. But regardless of the terminology, ANSI ASC X12 includes EDI standards used to communicate digital B2B transactions for various global business processes. EDI X12 standards allow consistency among business documents and other kinds of enterprise functionality.

There are more than 300 different types of X12 EDI standards, all delegated by a different three-digit number, for numerous industries such as finance, government, health care, insurance, transportation, and others. ANSI ASC X12 also develops standards for CICA (Context Inspired Component Architecture) and XML schemas.

# TRADACOMS

TRADACOMS (TRAding DAA COMmunicationS) is the primary EDI standard for domestic trading in the United Kingdom, specifically the UK retail industry. While somewhat similar to the EDIFACT standard, TRADACOMS uses multi messages instead of relying on a format of single messaging. TRADACOMS communication is comprised of 26 messages structured in a hierarchy.

Each TRADACOMS message, much like EDIFACT, is given a six-letter application reference. For example, an invoice message is INVFIL, a payment order is PAYORD, a utility bill is UTLHDR, and so on.

# UN/EDIFACT

UN/EDIFACT, which is short for United Nations rules for Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport, is a set of internationally standardized communication guidelines for exchanged data tags and message types between computer systems in different networks. UN/EDIFACT standards structure data into segments, segments into messages, and messages into an interactive exchange protocol.

The syntax rules for EDIFACT describe the message (nesting, character sets, structures, etc.) The data tags detail the different types of data being exchanged and how each is represented. The message types are also known as UNSMs (United Nations Standard Messages).

# ODETTE

ODETTE stands for Organization of Data Exchange by Tele Transmission in Europe and creates data exchange and communications standards for the European automotive industry. It is similar to North Americaâ€™s AIAG (Automotive Industry Action Group). ODETTE develops protocols such as OFTP and the more advanced OFTP2, which provides enhanced security through encryption methods and digital certificates for EDI data exchange.

Deploying B2B and MFT (managed file transfer) solutions that are ODETTE-certified for OFTP and OFTP2 allows a company to securely and efficiently communicate with various software to successfully exchange data.

Other common EDI standards include:

RosettaNet, based on XML, is used broadly in the supply chain, manufacturing, and services industries
GS1 EDI is used in retail globally
HL7 required by HIPAA regulation is predominant in U.S. healthcare
